        Being a list person is great! There are so many kinds of lists, that you can create a list for everything. Here's just a few ways that lists are helping me everythe day the Lord hath made, let us be glad and rejoice in it!  </p>
        <p className={styles.text}> love lists. As I started to use list, itâ€™s eye-opening just how much you can achieve when youâ€™re working from a list, and thatâ€™s important to me. My time taking classes on-line, working on projects really taught me the value of organisation, and one of the methods I use (and will continue to use) is lists.Using lists has a number of advantages. You can easily see whatâ€™s coming up, what needs immediate attention, and what youâ€™ve been putting off doing. If you save your lists, itâ€™s also a nice record of what youâ€™ve achieved. Being able to see how much Iâ€™ve done can really inspire me to do just a little more. Or helps to ease the anxiety that Iâ€™ve not done enough.</p>
        <p>This is a person list.</p>
        <Link href="/persons">
        <a className={styles.btn}>See Person Listing</a>
        </Link>
